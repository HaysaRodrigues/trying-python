# Trying Python

This repository has the intent of keep all my rotine of studies about Python. 

To do this I am following the instructions of the book [Automate Boring Stuff Python Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming/dp/1593275994) by Al Sweigart.
The book is awesome! But it worth to remember that this repository it's just about the way I have been arranging my studies based on book's samples.

Let's see what to find in each part of this repository:

1. [applications](https://github.com/HaysaRodrigues/trying-python/tree/master/applications): samples of applications made in python, all done following the book Automate Boring Stuff Python Programming mentioned before.

2. [introduction](https://github.com/HaysaRodrigues/trying-python/tree/master/introduction):
Basic concepts of python, Hello World, Math Operations, manipulating values.
