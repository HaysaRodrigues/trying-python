# Trying Python :snake:

This repository has the intent of keep all my rotine of studies about Python. 

To do this I am following the instructions of the book [Automate Boring Stuff Python Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming/dp/1593275994) by Al Sweigart.
The book is awesome! But it worth to remember that this repository it's just about the way I have been arranging my studies based on book's samples.

You can find more about the book:
